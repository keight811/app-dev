# My Favourite series of all time is **Parks and Recreation**

**Why is it my favourite?**

1. The show is hilarious, and I love how it keeps things light and funny.
2. All the characters are so likeable—it’s hard to pick a favorite.
3. Leslie Knope is such an amazing character; I want her to the world's president.
4. And Ben Wyatt? He’s just so adorable.
